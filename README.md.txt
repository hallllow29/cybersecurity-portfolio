### Cybersecurity Student & Aspiring Penetration Tester

### 👋 About Me

I am a passionate and driven cybersecurity student based in Portugal, currently in my final year of a Bachelor's degree. My primary interests lie in offensive security, network analysis, and vulnerability assessment. I thrive on the challenge of understanding how systems work in order to secure them, and I am constantly learning by solving challenges on platforms like TryHackMe and building a practical, hands-on skillset.

My goal is to begin a career as a Penetration Tester, where I can apply my analytical skills and technical knowledge to help organizations improve their security posture.
