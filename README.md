### 💻 Cybersecurity Student & Aspiring Penetration Tester

---

### 👋 About Me

I am a passionate and driven cybersecurity student from Portugal, currently completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Networks and Security.  
My main interests lie in **offensive security**, **network analysis**, and **vulnerability assessment**. I enjoy understanding how systems work in order to secure them more effectively.

I continuously learn by solving challenges on **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box**, while building a strong hands-on skillset in penetration testing and network defense.

My goal is to begin a career as a **Penetration Tester**, applying my analytical mindset and technical expertise to help organizations strengthen their security posture.
