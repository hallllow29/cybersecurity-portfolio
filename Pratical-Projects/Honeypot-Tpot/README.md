# Project: Live Honeypot Deployment & Threat Analysis

* **Author:** Pedro Antunes
* **Date:** July 2025

### 1. Project Objectives
The primary goal of this project was to gain pratical, hands-on experience in defensive security and threat intelligence by:
* Deploying a multi-service honeypot (T-Pot) in a live cloud environment.
* Capturing and analyzing real-world, unsolicited attack traffic from the internet.
* Understanding common attacker Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).
* Learning about system monitoring, log analysis, and data visualization with tools like the ELK stack.

### 2. Architecture & Setup

The honeypot was deployed on a cloud virtual machine to ensure complete isolation from my personal network and to attract organic internet traffic.

* **Cloud Provider:** DigitalOcean
* **Virtual Machine Specs:**
    * 8 GB RAM 
    * 4 vCPUs
    * 160 GB Disk Storage
* **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04 (LTS)
* **Honeypot Software:** T-Pot Standard Edition (which includes multiple honeypots like Cowrie, Dionaea, Honeytrap, etc.).

**Network Configuration:**
All common service ports were exposed to maximize the attack surface. Administrative SSH access was moved to a non-standard high port (64295), and the web management UI runs on port 64297. Both are protected via firewall rules allowing only trusted IPs.


## 3. Data & Findings

After just over 24 hours of operation, the honeypot registered over **35,000 attack events**, showcasing the sheer volume of opportunistic scans and attacks present on the open internet.

### 3.1 Honeypot Sensor Distribution

The following graph shows the number of events captured by each honeypot sensor running on T-Pot:

![Honeypot Attack Histogram](./images/03-attack-histogram.png)

> ‚è±Ô∏è **Observation:**  
> - Attack traffic fluctuates heavily, with periodic spikes reaching up to **3,000+ attacks/hour**.  
> - The number of unique IP addresses remains relatively constant, indicating repeated automated probing from specific sources (likely botnets).

---

### 3.4 Targeted Ports Over Time

The following chart displays the volume of attacks over time, segmented by **destination port**. This allows us to identify which services attackers are attempting to exploit.

![Attacks by Destination Port Histogram](./images/04-port-histogram.png)

| Port   | Service                   |
|------  |---------------------------|
| `5060` | SIP (VoIP)              |
| `445`  | SMB (Windows File Share)|
| `22`   | SSH                     |
| `80`   | HTTP (Web)              |
| `3333` | Common custom/backdoor  |

> üö® **Notable Observations:**
> - A **massive spike on port 445** (SMB) likely indicates mass scanning for **EternalBlue-type vulnerabilities** or Windows file share exploits.
> - Port **5060 (SIP)** and **22 (SSH)** also saw sustained interest, reflecting common attack vectors for VoIP abuse and brute-force login attempts.
> - Even obscure ports like `3333` were regularly hit, suggesting **wide-range port scanning**.

### 3.5 Geographic Attack Distribution

### 3.8 Honeypot Attack Summary (Pie Chart)

This final visualization summarizes the distribution of attacks per honeypot service:

![Attacks by Honeypot Pie](./images/09-honeypot-pie.png)

> üß© **Insight:**  
> Cowrie, Honeytrap, and Sentrypeer again dominate, as seen earlier. This pie chart reinforces the idea that attackers focus on SSH and general port scans above all else.

### 3.9 Intrusion Detection Alerts (Suricata)

Suricata is a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) included in T-Pot. The chart below shows the volume and category of alerts triggered over time:

![Suricata Alert Histogram](./images/10-suricata-histogram.png)

> üö® **Top Alert Categories Detected:**
> - **Generic Protocol Command Decode**  
> - **Detection of a Network Scan**  
> - **Misc Activity**  
> - **Attempted Administrator Privilege Gain**

These alerts help identify common exploitation attempts or suspicious payloads, often invisible at a firewall level.

### 3.10 SSH Brute Force Attempts (Credentials)

Cowrie recorded thousands of login attempts with a wide variety of usernames and passwords. Below are the most common:

#### Most Used Usernames

![Username Tagcloud](./images/11-username-tagcloud.png)

> üë§ **Top usernames attempted:**
> - `root` (1192 attempts)
> - `admin`, `oracle`, `user`, `ubuntu`, `test`
> - Some usernames suggest **automated targeting** of specific software or environments (`solana`, `git`, `sa`)

#### Most Used Passwords

![Password Tagcloud](./images/12-password-tagcloud.png)

> üîë **Top passwords attempted:**
> - Obvious weak passwords: `123456`, `admin`, `123`, `password`
> - User-specific guesses: `3245gs5662d34`, `Focushns`, `FattMan1234567890`
> - Blank or empty passwords were also frequently tried

> üß† **Conclusion:** These credentials clearly indicate the use of brute force automation tools that test common and weak combinations. Using strong, unique credentials and key-based authentication is essential.

### 3.11 Top ASNs and Source IPs

This table provides insight into the **most active Autonomous Systems (ASNs)** and **top source IP addresses** involved in attacks:

![Top ASNs and Source IPs](./images/13-asn-and-ips.png)

> üåê **Top ASNs by Attack Volume:**
> - **OVH SAS** ‚Äì 5,728 events  
> - **Republican Unitary Telecomm.** ‚Äì 3,168 events  
> - **IP Volume Inc.** ‚Äì 2,693 events  
> - **Google Cloud** and **DigitalOcean** also appear, indicating use of public cloud infrastructure for scanning or attacks  
> - Some AS names are intentionally obfuscated (possibly privacy-protected or malicious actors using hidden ASN registration)

> üìä **Top Attacking IPs:**
> - IPs like `178.124.158.226` and `5.196.110.246` were involved in **3,000+ attacks each**
> - This shows that **a few IPs are responsible for high-volume, automated activity**
> - These could be scanning bots or compromised machines used in distributed attacks

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** It's important to remember that these IPs may not represent the original attacker ‚Äî they could belong to compromised hosts or VPN exits.

### 3.12 Suricata Alert Signatures (Top 10)

In addition to the alert categories, Suricata also logs specific **signatures** triggered by suspicious or malformed traffic. The table below shows the most frequently triggered signatures:

![Suricata Alert Signatures](./images/14-suricata-signatures.png)

> üß™ **Top Alert Signatures:**
> - `SURICATA IPv4 truncated packet` and `AF-PACKET truncated packet` ‚Äî may indicate malformed or fuzzed packets used in evasion attempts.
> - `SSH invalid banner` and `SSH session in progress on unusual port` ‚Äî often signal automated SSH scanners or misconfigured clients.
> - Several `SURICATA STREAM` events point to **TCP irregularities**, such as retransmissions, missing sessions, or protocol misuse.

> üîç **Takeaway:**  
> These alerts provide low-level visibility into the **technical fingerprint** of attackers ‚Äî not just the services they target, but **how they behave at the packet level**.

## 4. Lessons Learned

This project provided real-world exposure to the scale and tactics of opportunistic attacks targeting exposed systems on the public internet. Key takeaways include:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è The internet is **constantly scanned** ‚Äî even fresh, unadvertised IPs receive thousands of attacks within minutes.
- üîê **SSH brute-force** and **service discovery scans** are the most common tactics observed.
- üß† Attackers rely heavily on **weak/default credentials**, making hardening and monitoring essential.
- üîé **Suricata IDS** added another layer of visibility by capturing low-level traffic anomalies.
- üìä Data visualization via the **ELK stack** enabled clear insight into attacker behavior patterns.

The experience also helped reinforce important defensive skills:

- Deploying and isolating cloud infrastructure for security testing.
- Parsing and analyzing real-time log data.
- Interpreting raw indicators (IP reputation, ports, ASNs, protocols) and transforming them into actionable intelligence.

## 5. Future Work

To expand on this project and continue learning, here are some planned next steps:

- üìÜ **Extend the deployment** window to capture more meaningful trends over time.
- üåê Automate **threat enrichment** (GeoIP, ASN, Shodan lookups) for attacker IPs.
- üì° Compare T-Pot with other honeypot solutions (e.g., [OpenCanary](https://github.com/thinkst/opencanary)).
- üìà Build a live dashboard with **Grafana** or integrate with SIEM tools like **Wazuh** or **TheHive**.
- üîî Configure **alerting mechanisms** to get notified on high-risk behavior in real time.
