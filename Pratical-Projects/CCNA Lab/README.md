## ðŸ”¹ Introduction

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an **enterprise multi-layer hierarchical network** in GNS3, following Ciscoâ€™s **three-tier model** (Access, Distribution, Core).  
The lab integrates multiple CCNA topics including VLANs, Inter-VLAN routing, OSPF, WAN integration, redundancy, and VLSM addressing.

The following diagram represents the logical topology of the enterprise network:

____
## ðŸ”¹ Basic Device Configuration (Initial Setup)

This section covers the **initial baseline configuration** applied to all devices (routers and switches).  
The goal is to ensure every device has a unique hostname, secure access (console, vty, and enable passwords), and a consistent structure before applying advanced features.

### Hostname Convention

- **WAN / ISP Routers**: `R1-ISP-1`, `R1-ISP-2`
- **Core Switches (L3)**: `SW-L3-CORE-1`, `SW-L3-CORE-2`
- **Distribution Switches (L3)**: `SW-L3-DIST-A`, `SW-L3-DIST-B`
- **Access Switches (L2)**: `SW-L2-1-ACC-A1`, `SW-L2-2-ACC-A2`, `SW-L2-1-ACC-B1`, `SW-L2-2-ACC-B2`
`
Password and Access Configuration
```bash
! Set hostname
hostname <DEVICE_NAME>

! Enable secret password
enable secret cisco123

! Encrypt all passwords
service password-encryption

! Console access
line console 0
 password cisco
 login
 logging synchronous

! VTY access (Telnet/SSH)
line vty 0 4
 password cisco
 login
 transport input ssh telnet

```

SSH Preparation (for remote access)

```bash
! Set domain name
ip domain-name lab.local

! Generate RSA keys
crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024

! Local user for SSH login
username admin secret admin123

! Configure VTY lines for local login
line vty 0 4
 login local
 transport input ssh
```

âœ… With this baseline:

- Devices are uniquely identified.
- Access is secured with encrypted passwords.
- SSH provides secure remote management.

____
## ðŸ”¹ VLSM Addressing Plan

The entire topology was addressed using the private block **192.168.0.0/24**, which was subnetted with **Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)** to efficiently allocate IP space across VLANs and WAN links.

The design principle followed was:

- Start allocating from the **largest subnet requirement** (VLAN10 â€“ IT).
- Continue sequentially with smaller VLANs.
- Reserve /30 networks for WAN point-to-point links.

| VLAN/Link         | Network Address  | Subnet Mask     | Broadcast Address | Usable Range                  | Purpose            |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------ |
| VLAN10 â€“ IT       | 192.168.0.0/26   | 255.255.255.192 | 192.168.0.63      | 192.168.0.1 â€“ 192.168.0.62    | IT Department PCs  |
| VLAN20 â€“ Finance  | 192.168.0.64/27  | 255.255.255.224 | 192.168.0.95      | 192.168.0.65 â€“ 192.168.0.94   | Finance Department |
| VLAN30 â€“ HR       | 192.168.0.96/28  | 255.255.255.240 | 192.168.0.111     | 192.168.0.97 â€“ 192.168.0.110  | HR Department PCs  |
| VLAN40 â€“ Mgmt     | 192.168.0.112/28 | 255.255.255.240 | 192.168.0.127     | 192.168.0.113 â€“ 192.168.0.126 | Device Management  |
| VLAN99 â€“ Native   | 192.168.0.128/30 | 255.255.255.252 | 192.168.0.131     | 192.168.0.129 â€“ 192.168.0.130 | Native VLAN/Trunks |
| WAN1 (ISP1â€“CORE1) | 192.168.0.132/30 | 255.255.255.252 | 192.168.0.135     | 192.168.0.133 â€“ 192.168.0.134 | ISP1 link          |
| WAN2 (ISP2â€“CORE2) | 192.168.0.136/30 | 255.255.255.252 | 192.168.0.139     | 192.168.0.137 â€“ 192.168.0.138 | ISP2 link          |

âœ… With this addressing plan:

- Each VLAN has just enough IP addresses for its expected hosts.
- WAN links are efficiently allocated with /30 subnets.
- The entire design fits inside the original **192.168.0.0/24** block without waste.

___
## ðŸ”¹ VLAN and Inter-VLAN Configuration

- VLANs were defined at the Access layer.
- Distribution switches provided **Inter-VLAN Routing** via subinterfaces.

Example (SW-L3-DIST-A):

```bash
interface e1/2.10
 encapsulation dot1Q 10
 ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.192

interface e1/2.20
 encapsulation dot1Q 20
 ip address 192.168.0.65 255.255.255.224

interface e1/2.40
 encapsulation dot1Q 40
 ip address 192.168.0.113 255.255.255.240

```

`ip routing` was enabled to allow communication across VLANs.

____
## ðŸ”¹ Distribution Redundancy (DIST-A â†” DIST-B)

Two /30 point-to-point links ensured redundancy between Distribution switches.  
OSPF propagated VLAN routes across both blocks.

Example (DIST-A):
```bash
interface e1/0
 ip address 192.168.0.141 255.255.255.252
interface e1/1
 ip address 192.168.0.145 255.255.255.252

router ospf 1
 network 192.168.0.0 0.0.0.63 area 0
 network 192.168.0.64 0.0.0.31 area 0
 network 192.168.0.112 0.0.0.15 area 0
 network 192.168.0.140 0.0.0.3 area 0
 network 192.168.0.144 0.0.0.3 area 0
```

âœ… Result: VLANs from both sides are reachable with redundant paths.
___
## ðŸ”¹ Coreâ€“ISP Integration (WAN)

Each Core switch connects to a dedicated ISP router using /30 links.

- Static default routes were configured on Cores.
- ISPs used static return routes.
- OSPF redistributed the default route enterprise-wide.

âœ… Internal hosts gained Internet reachability via both ISPs.

___
## ðŸ”¹ Core Interconnect (CORE1 â†” CORE2)

A /30 link was configured directly between the two Core switches.  
This provides:

- Extra OSPF adjacency.
- Redundant paths across the backbone.
- Load balancing (ECMP).

___
## ðŸ”¹ Validation

- **Ping tests**: VLAN gateways, inter-VLAN routing, WAN connectivity.
- **OSPF neighbors**: Verified on Distribution and Core.
- **End-to-End reachability**: PCs could reach ISP routers.

Screenshots included in the report confirm functionality.

____
## ðŸ”¹ Coreâ€“ISP Integration (WAN)

To provide external connectivity, each Core switch was connected to a dedicated ISP router using /30 subnets.  
The Core switches were configured with static default routes pointing to their respective ISP next-hop, and the ISPs were configured with static return routes back to the enterprise LAN.  
To distribute the default route dynamically across the enterprise, OSPF was used with the `default-information originate` command.

SW-L3-CORE-1 (connected to ISP1)

```bash
interface e0/0
 description Link to ISP1
 ip address 192.168.0.134 255.255.255.252

 no shutdown

ip route 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.0.134
```

ISP-2 Router

```bash
interface e0/0
 ip address 192.168.0.137 255.255.255.252

___ 
âœ… With this configuration, all internal VLANs have external connectivity through both Core routers. Each ISP has a static return path, and default routes are dynamically injected into the enterprise OSPF domain.

___
## ðŸ”¹ Core Interconnect (CORE1 â†” CORE2)

To ensure full redundancy and equal-cost multipath routing, a dedicated point-to-point /30 network was configured between the two Core switches. This provides an additional OSPF adjacency and allows traffic to traverse the opposite core in case of a link or ISP failure.

SW-L3-CORE-1

```bash
interface e0/2
 description Link to CORE2
 ip address 192.168.0.149 255.255.255.252
 no shutdown

router ospf 1
 no passive-interface e0/2
 network 192.168.0.148 0.0.0.3 area 0
```

SW-L3-CORE-2

```bash
interface e0/2
 description Link to CORE1
 ip address 192.168.0.150 255.255.255.252
 no shutdown

router ospf 1
 no passive-interface e0/2
 network 192.168.0.148 0.0.0.3 area 0
```

___

___

âœ… With this configuration, the two Core switches maintain a direct OSPF adjacency.  
The enterprise routing domain now supports **redundant paths** and **load balancing** across both Cores, improving resiliency and stability.

___
## ðŸ”¹ Conclusion

This lab successfully demonstrates the design and implementation of a multi-layer hierarchical enterprise network using GNS3.  
Key objectives were achieved as follows:

- **Baseline configuration** was applied to all devices, including hostname conventions, secure passwords, and SSH access.
- **VLSM subnetting** ensured efficient use of the 192.168.0.0/24 block, with dedicated ranges for user VLANs, management, and WAN point-to-point links.
- **VLAN segmentation** was deployed at the Access layer, with Inter-VLAN routing provided by the Distribution switches.
- **Dynamic routing with OSPF** was configured between Distribution and Core layers, ensuring full reachability and redundancy.
- **Coreâ€“Core interconnect** allowed equal-cost multipath routing and resiliency.
- **WAN integration with ISPs** provided external connectivity, with static default routes injected into the OSPF domain for distribution across the enterprise.

âœ… With this design, the network supports:

- Segmentation of departments through VLANs.
- Redundant paths and high availability across the Distribution and Core layers.
- External connectivity via dual ISPs.
- A scalable and modular topology, aligned with Ciscoâ€™s three-tier hierarchical design principles (Access, Distribution, Core).

This project consolidates key CCNA topics including VLANs, trunking, Inter-VLAN routing, OSPF, IP addressing with VLSM, and WAN integration, and serves as a strong portfolio piece for enterprise network design.
